## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data). The size of the data is approximetely 7.7GB. 

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*

3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
